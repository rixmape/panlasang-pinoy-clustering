i mentioned earlier about the beans being so soft while cooking in syrup. i notice the beans after drying out and coating with powdered sugar, they will start to harden a bit. so, it is good that your beans are fully cooked. like i said not mushy but very soft.
i used a can of pineapple tidbits and cut them into small cubes. you can also use crushed pineapple if you want. drained and juice was reserved for the glaze. if using fresh pineapple, you can substitute the pineapple juice with lemon juice
