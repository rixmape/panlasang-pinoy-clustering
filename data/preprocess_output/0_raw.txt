After coating with powdered sugar, place them on a tray or any container but leave them uncovered. You can eat them right away but leftovers can be allowed to air dry. It will give more ample time for the sugar to completely dry out. If you cover the container and or place them immediately in small bags, because of lack of air, the sugar will melt and the beans will become moist.

I mentioned earlier about the beans being so soft while cooking in syrup. I notice the beans after drying out and coating with powdered sugar, they will start to harden a bit. So, it is good that your beans are fully cooked. Like I said not mushy but very soft.
I used a can of pineapple tidbits and cut them into small cubes. You can also use crushed pineapple if you want. Drained and juice was reserved for the glaze. If using fresh pineapple, you can substitute the pineapple juice with lemon juice or totally omit and add a small amount of milk instead.
INUTAK

Ice cubes or omit if you want hot milk
If you are not a chocolate fan, leave it plain or decorate with some raspberries or strawberries for color.
If you cannot find or if the sweetened coconut flakes are not available, you can use sweetened shredded coconut instead. If using unsweetened, adjust the amount of sugar in the cake batter. Instead of using 1/2 cup, make it 2/3 cup.

Make sure to sift the dry ingredients together so that they are well incorporated. I also find that cocoa powder contains little chocolate balls that you'll catch on the sifter. Do not toss that but instead use your hand, a spoon or spatula to press it against the sieve to make fine crumbs.
Make sure to use a non-stick pan.

When mixing the dry ingredients with the cake batter, make sure to beat on the lowest speed setting. The goal here is to lightly incorporate the ingredients together. When just combined, use a spatula to scrape the sides of bowl and fold until the batter is smooth. Overbeating makes the cake dry and you don't want that.
